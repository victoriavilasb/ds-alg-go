# Algorithms and Data Structures in Golang with Unittests

- [ ] Arrays: An array is a collection of elements, where each element can be accessed by an index. It is a simple and fundamental data structure.

- [x] Linked Lists: A linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes connected by pointers. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

- [ ] Stacks: A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The elements are added and removed from the same end.

- [ ] Queues: A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The elements are added at the rear end and removed from the front end.

- [ ] Trees: A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node has a parent node and zero or more child nodes.

- [ ] Binary Trees: A binary tree is a type of tree where each node has at most two child nodes.

- [ ] Binary Search Trees: A binary search tree is a type of binary tree where the left child node is always smaller than the parent node, and the right child node is always larger.

- [ ] Heaps: A heap is a type of binary tree where each node is larger (or smaller) than its child nodes. It is used for sorting and priority queue implementations.

- [ ] Graphs: A graph is a data structure that consists of vertices and edges. It is used to represent relationships between entities.

- [ ] Hash Tables: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It is used for fast retrieval and insertion. 

- [ ] Dynamic Arrays: A dynamic array is an array that can grow or shrink in size dynamically during runtime.

- [ ] Doubly Linked Lists: A doubly linked list is a linked list where each node has a pointer to both its previous and next node.

- [ ] Circular Linked Lists: A circular linked list is a linked list where the last node points to the first node, creating a loop.

- [ ] Queue with Priority: A queue with priority is a queue where each element has a priority assigned to it. Elements with higher priority are dequeued before those with lower priority.

- [ ] AVL Trees: An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height of the left and right subtrees differ by at most one.

- [ ] Red-Black Trees: A red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node is either red or black, and the tree satisfies a set of properties that ensure balance.

- [ ] B-Trees: A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that can store large amounts of data on secondary storage devices.

- [ ] Trie: A trie is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of data where each node represents a letter of a word.

- [ ] Bloom Filters: A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.

- [ ] Disjoint-set data structure: A disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
